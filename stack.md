Here is the exhaustive list of technologies found across those specific postings, including the ones I missed:
### 1. Backend & Logic (The Heavy Lifters)
 * Java: Mentioned as a core backend language for enterprise systems (especially for roles that involve building scalable services).
 * Python: Specifically mentioned for Data Engineering, scripting, and backend automation (your "Excel on steroids" goal).
 * C# / .NET: Still a major player in these specific ads for Windows-based enterprise apps.
 * Node.js: Using TypeScript/JavaScript for backend services and server-side logic.
### 2. Frontend & Scripting
 * TypeScript / JavaScript: Essential for the "Full Stack" side of these backend roles, often paired with React or Angular.
 * Python (for Data): Used for manipulating large datasets and building data pipelines.
### 3. Databases & Data (Your Favorite Part)
 * SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server): The universal language for "Excel on steroids."
 * NoSQL (MongoDB / DynamoDB): Some of these postings look for modern, non-relational database experience for high-speed data.
 * Database Design: Normalization, schema modeling, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
### 4. Modern Infrastructure (The "Work from Home" Stack)
 * Docker & Kubernetes: Containerization—this is how private sector companies ensure code works the same on your home laptop as it does on their servers.
 * Cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP): The postings vary, but they all want experience with at least one major cloud provider.
 * Git / CI/CD: Automation of testing and deployment.

## Updated Project Goal: "The Polyglot Ledger"
Since you know these languages, we should make your project show off that range. Instead of just a C# app, let’s build a system that uses your existing strengths:
 * The Core (Java/Spring Boot): Build the main API that manages the database using Java.
 * The Data Processor (Python): Write a Python script that takes a "Messy Excel Spreadsheet" and cleans/imports it into your database (The "Steroids" part).
 * The Database (PostgreSQL): Use a robust relational database to handle the relationships.
 * The Automation (Docker): Package the whole thing so a recruiter can run it with one command.

Why this wins for you:
 * It proves you can leave the "Government/Power Apps" bubble.
 * It uses Java (which you know) and Python (which you're learning).
 * It directly targets the "Remote" requirement because Docker/Cloud skills are the "passport" to work-from-home roles.
